Summary of the CAPE Budget File (AOP Budget) Discussion
Introduction and Setup:

The session starts with ensuring the recording has begun and the screen is shared and visible to participants.
Total Requirement and Inventory Check:

Calculate the total requirement.
Subtract on-hand inventory to determine if it's sufficient.
Example: If the sum of requirements minus on-hand inventory is negative, existing inventory is sufficient.
Excess Supply Calculation:

Formula: Excess Supply = Inventory + Open PO - Requirement.
Example: With inventory and PO combined at 11,500 units and an open PO component of 903 units.
Ensure calculations match the main model, adjusting for multiple quarters if necessary.
Pivot Table Adjustments:

Update pivot table formulas manually to reflect correct quarters.
Verify pivot table data aligns with the main model.
Example Analysis (Row 25):

Example of calculation: Open PO of 11 units and a requirement of 3 units results in an excess PO of 8 units.
Reporting in Dollar Values:

Convert unit calculations into dollar values for final reports.
Handling Cancellations:

Ensure cancelled POs are automatically excluded in the next data cycle.
Opportunity Reports Layout:

CapEx has been moved to a separate file, while PO and Disposition remain.
Disposition reports focus on excess supply from inventory only.
Report Structure:

Provide a summary of categories in descending order, with optional SAC.
Include detailed tables with requester information for tagging and further discussion.
Data Automation and Reference:

Data is pulled from the main model and reference files.
Automate links and references for consistent updates and reporting.
Quarterly Formula Updates:

Update manual formulas when quarters change to maintain consistency.
Ensure links and references are correctly traced.
KPIs and CapEx Opportunity Reports:

Detailed calculation approach in columns H to N.
Calculate remaining CapEx and target CapEx for actionable reporting.
Ensure correct time horizon selection for accurate excess CapEx opportunity reporting.
Final Notes:

Ensure correct formula application and consistent data updates.
Automate processes where possible to reduce errors and improve efficiency.
Provide clear and detailed summaries and reports for review and decision-making.
This summary captures the key points and steps discussed during the session on handling the CAPE budget file, ensuring participants understand the process and can effectively manage and report on budget and inventory data.

Steps to Recreate the CAPE Budget (AOP Budget) View from Raw Data
Set Up the Initial Data:

Ensure all required raw data is collected and accessible, including inventory, open POs, and requirements.
Organize data into relevant columns in an Excel sheet or appropriate data model.
Calculate Total Requirement:

Sum up the total requirements for each item.
Ensure the data is correctly formatted and calculations are accurate.
Subtract On-Hand Inventory:

Subtract the on-hand inventory from the total requirement to determine if the existing inventory is sufficient.
Example: Total Requirement - On-Hand Inventory.
Determine Excess Supply:

Use the formula: Excess Supply = Inventory + Open PO - Requirement.
Trace the numbers for each item to ensure calculations are accurate.
Update Pivot Tables:

Manually update pivot table formulas to reflect the correct quarters.
Ensure the pivot table data matches the main modelâ€™s calculations.
Adjust the formulas as necessary when quarters change.
Analyze Specific Rows (Example: Row 25):

Check specific rows for discrepancies or to trace specific calculations.
Example: For Row 25, verify that Open PO - Requirement equals the excess PO.
Convert Units to Dollar Values:

Convert the unit calculations into dollar values for the final report.
Ensure that the conversion is consistent and accurately reflects the financial data.
Handle PO Cancellations:

Ensure that cancelled POs are automatically excluded from future data cycles.
Regularly update the data to reflect any changes or cancellations.
Structure the Opportunity Reports:

Create separate sections for CapEx, PO, and Disposition reports.
For Disposition reports, focus on the excess supply from inventory only.
Prepare the Report Layout:

Provide a summary of categories in descending order.
Include SAC (if needed) and a summary of dollar values.
Provide detailed tables with requester information for tagging and further discussions.
Automate Data Links and References:

Ensure that data is automatically pulled from the main model and reference files.
Trace and verify links and references to maintain data integrity.
Quarterly Formula Updates:

Update manual formulas to reflect the current quarter.
Ensure consistency by verifying that the updated formulas match the data from the main model.
Create KPI and CapEx Opportunity Reports:

Follow the detailed calculation approach outlined in columns H to N.
Calculate remaining CapEx and target CapEx for actionable reporting.
Ensure correct time horizon selection in the controls tab of the main model.
Finalize the Report:

Copy-paste relevant data into the summary table for record-keeping.
Include points of discussion and reasons for any unrealized opportunities.
Ensure realized opportunities are actionable and accurately reported.
Review and Verify:

Double-check all calculations and data entries for accuracy.
Ensure that the final report is comprehensive and correctly formatted.
Following these steps will help in recreating the view from raw data for the CAPE budget (AOP budget) and ensuring accurate and actionable financial reporting.
